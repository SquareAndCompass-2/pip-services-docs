    The persistence components come in two kinds. The first kind is a basic persistence that can work with any object types and provides only minimal set of operations. The second kind is called “identifieable” persistence and works with “identifable” data objects, i.e. objects that have unique ID field. The identifiable persistence provides a full set or CRUD operations that covers most common cases.
